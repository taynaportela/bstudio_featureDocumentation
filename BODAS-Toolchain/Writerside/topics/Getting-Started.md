# Getting Started

<!--Writerside adds this topic when you create a new documentation project.
You can use it as a sandbox to play with Writerside features, and remove it from the TOC when you don't need it anymore.-->

## 1. Install data and software
You can create empty topics, or choose a template for different types of content that contains some boilerplate structure to help you get started:

![Create new topic options](new_topic_options.png){ width=290 }{border-effect=line}

## 2. Watch Tutorials
%product% supports two types of markup: Markdown and XML.
When you create a new help article, you can choose between two topic types, but this doesn't mean you have to stick to a single format.
You can author content in Markdown and extend it with semantic attributes or inject entire XML elements.

## 3. Open and work with HelloWorld Template
