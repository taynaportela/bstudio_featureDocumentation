| **Installer**  | Installs all necessary tools for using BODAS-Studio and checks for the correct installation of any required third-party tools such as Excel or 7-Zip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |              |
| **ASWT (including BODAS Workflow)** | The ASW-Template (ASWT) provides a structured project base for development based on the MASAR architecture. It includes a predefined folder structure, a minimal application with basic functionalities (Error Manager, Parameter Manager, etc.), as well as scripts/tools for automating development tasks and serves as the foundation for every MASAR project. The ASWT includes a C Standard Library (MASAR-service library) that is safety-qualified and directly usable in safety projects, a pre-built BODAS Workflow and a toolbox for modeling MASAR components within MATLAB/Simulink. |              |
| **MASAR-studio** | Engineering tool for supporting the integration of components and functions in MASAR-based ASW. It provides workflows for managing classes, configuring parameters, and preparing diagnosis. All workflows also have a connection to the Service Interface tool to facilitate Service Interface creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |              |
| **BODAS-service Editor** | BODAS-service Editor is a PC-Tool that enables the creation of user-defined content for BODAS-service. The tool is aimed towards software suppliers that want to provide the ability to use the BODAS-service tool for diagnosis of their ECU Software to their customers. By using this tool, software suppliers can determine which diagnostic services can be accessed from a specific application software in BODAS-service.                                                                                                                                                                 |              |
| **(Optional) BODAS-service** | BODAS-service is a PC-Tool used for servicing components of the Bosch Rexrothâ€™s Mobile Electronics division. It supports all the necessary diagnostic functions for flashing, calibration and diagnostic of the electronic devices. Note that BODAS-service requires separate installation and licensing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |              |
|  **(Optional) MATLAB/Simulink** | MATLAB Simulink is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating, and analyzing multidomain dynamic systems. Currently used in BODAS-studio for modeling MASAR components and generating C-code, there are plans to extend its use to model entire systems without writing C-code. Updates on this expansion will be communicated promptly. Note that MATLAB Simulink requires separate installation and licensing.                                                                                                                                                               |              |

Each version of BODAS-studio comes with a migrator that assists developers in migrating their ASWT versions.
??? Where are the migrators???
